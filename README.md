Bourbon's Neat grid classes because you need them for some reason

Note
----
This tiny set of classes will go against Neat's premise, which is to keep grid logic out of the HTML markup.

You should NOT use this if
--------------------------
Your app is not currently Bourbon-dependant and you do not need a class-based grid system.

Here are some useful grid systems you can look at:

- [960 Grid system](http://960.gs/)
- [Simple Grid](http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid/)
- [Wizardry Grids](http://csswizardry.com/csswizardry-grids/)


Why/When to use this
--------------------
Class based grid systems are actually quite great, they allow you to easily change the visual structure of your project without having to touch both CSS and HTML for every change. Also, they strongly prevent css style repetition. I'd suggest to use this set of classes if you like how Bourbon works and it's a must have in your project. If maybe you are following a module-focused CSS structure like [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) or you are using a strongly HTML focused front-end framework like [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/) or [KnockoutJs](http://knockoutjs.com/).
